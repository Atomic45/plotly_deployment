              Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and gently rub the surfaces inside your navel.
              Next, use a fresh one dipped in water to rinse the alcohol so it doesnâ€™t dry your skin.

            <h4>Is There Research?</h4>
            <p>
                The National Library of Medicine published an article that outlines the findinss of their research. In the 60 samples 
                of belly buttons considered here, we found 2368 phylotypes of bacteria based on 144,403 sequence reads, 
                excluding sequences of insufficient quality (see Supporting Information S1). These phylotypes likely correspond to far more 
                than 2368 biological species. Our 3% cut-off is standard in microbial studies, but is conservative so that a given 
                phylotype is likely to include multiple species-level lineages. Also, the overall rarefaction curves for belly button 
                bacterial phylotypes failed to level off, suggesting additional phylotypes would have been encountered were more 
                individuals sampled, or were additional human populations considered (whether from different regions or different 
                genetic backgrounds). Even conservatively considering just the 2368 phylotypes, our diversity of bacterial 
                phylotypes was more than twice as great as the species diversity of, for example, North American birds or ants.
